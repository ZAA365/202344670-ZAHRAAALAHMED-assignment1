# Personal Portfolio Website

A responsive personal portfolio website with light/dark mode toggle functionality.

**Project description**
This is my first personal portfolio website created for my web design course. The website showcases my background, projects, and includes a contact form. It features a dark/light mode toggle that allows users to switch between themes for better viewing comfort.

**Setup instructions (how to run locally)**
1. **Download the files** - Save all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in one folder
2. **Create folders** - Make sure you have these folders in your project:
   - `css/` for styles.css
   - `js/` for script.js  
   - `assets/images/` for project images
3. **Open the website** - Double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your browser
4. **Test dark mode** - Click the "🌙 Switch Mode" button to toggle between light and dark themes

**Short summary of AI use (detailed in ai-usage-report.md)**
I used AI tools to help me understand web development concepts, debug issues, and improve my code. Detailed usage is documented in [ai-usage-report.md](ai-usage-report.md).
