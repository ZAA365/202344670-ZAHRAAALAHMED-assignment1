### Responsible Use & Modifications

**How I reviewed and modified AI suggestions:**
1. **Always tested code** - I never just copied and pasted, I always tested the code first
2. **Made it my own** - I modified AI suggestions to match my personal style and requirements
3. **Understood the code** - I made sure I understood what each line of code was doing
4. **Compared solutions** - When AI gave multiple options, I chose the one that made the most sense to me
5. **Added comments** - I added my own comments to document what the code does
6. **Kept it simple** - I asked for beginner-friendly explanations and simplified complex suggestions

**Academic integrity practices:**
* All final code decisions were made by me
* I wrote all the content about myself
* I designed the overall structure and layout
* I asked for explanations, not just code
* I used AI as a learning tool, not as a way to avoid doing the work myself

**Personal modifications made:**
